          <h1>Iceland's Unique Landscape</h1>
          <p> Iceland is a unique country in more way than one; it is the one of the most active and productive terrestrial volcanic regions. It is the only place where the mid-Atlantic ridge crosses land. Iceland is a hot spot of volcanic activity placed over the spreading ridge of divergent tectonic plates, giving it a fascinating and constantly changing land surface. Known as the land of fire and ice, it has its name for good reason. Many notorious Icelandic volcanoes are located under glaciers, further increasing their potential to be deadly.

          <h1>Subglacial Volcanism and its Hazards</h1>
          <p>Volcano intensity is measured using Volcanic Explosivity Index (VEI). The scale goes from 0-8. The Richter scale is also important in assessing potentially dangerous volcanoes, as seismic activity is often a precursor to volcanic activity.</p>

          <p>Jökulhlaups (originally an Icelandic word), or meltwater floods, are incredibly common in subglacial eruptions, and can be dangerous both to property and to people. When a volcano erupts under ice, the ice typically melts to fill the caldera. With the increase in pressure, the ice on top can lift and release a flood of water, collecting anything from sediments to large boulders along the way with extreme force and speed.</p>

          <p>Other hazards are common with Icelandic volcanoes, particularly in stratovolcanoes that alternate between lava and tephra eruptions, are sulfur dioxide and ash release. Sulfur dioxide is a known health hazard to humans living in Iceland. Larger pieces of ejected tephra have the potential to be dangerous and can travel far distances as well. As seen with the eruption of Eyjafjallajökull, ash can cloud the surrounding air by spreading horizontally once it passes through the lower layer of the atmosphere, causing it stay in the air for much longer.</p>

          <h1>Notable Eruptions</h1>
          <h2>KATLA:</h2>
          <p>Katla has erupted 20 times 930 and 1918. Some smaller eruptions don't quite break the ice cover, but several have reached a VEI of 4-6. Partially underneath <b>Mýrdalsjökull</b>, its caldera is covered with 200-700 meters of ice. During the peak of Katla's 1755 eruption, flood discharge was equal to the average discharge of the Amazon, Mississippi, Nile, and Yangtze Rivers combined. Eruptions of Eyjafjallajökull are known to trigger eruptions of Katla. Tremors were felt in late August of 2016, the largest since 1977, which leads many geologists to believe that Katla may erupt in the near future.</p>

          <h2>GRÍMSVÖTN:</h2>
          <p>Situated in Iceland's Highlands under <b>Vatnajökull</b>, Europe's largest glacier, is the caldera of Grímsvötn. It has the highest eruption frequency of all volcanoes in Iceland, most of which are subglacial eruptions in which the interaction between magma and meltwater causes phreatomagmatic explosive activity. Notable eruptions took place in 1998 and 2004, but the most notable was from May 21-25, 2011, when an eruption cancelled 900 flights in the UK, Greenland, Germany, Ireland, and Norway. Its activity is known to be associated with Bárðarbunga, and seismic activity has been generally increasing in the area in recent years.</p>

          <h2>EYJAFJALLAJÖKULL:</h2>
          <p>Arguably the most well-known volcano in Iceland, its 2010 eruption was recorded to have a VEI of 4. Under <b>Eyjafjallajökull</b>, the volcano with the same name is a stratovolcano with a crater. There were several notable eruptions during the 1800s, but 2010 is by far the most famous eruption in Iceland's recent history. Beginning March 20, the explosive eruption led to meltwater in the volcanic vent. Air traffic to Northwestern Europe was stopped for six days. The extensive eruption ended May 23 and was declared dormant in August. Eyjafjallajökull is said to be connected to Katla in timing and activity.</p>

          <h2>BÁRÐARBUNGA:</h2>
          <p>Also under <b>Vatnajökull</b>, this stratovolcano lies within Vatnajökull National Park. Seismic activity gradually increased in its northern fissure system starting in 2007 until an eruption in 2014. From August of 2014 until February of 2015, this eruption impacted air quality in Iceland with large volumes of sulfur dioxide, which is a known health hazard. Bárðarbunga illustrates the importance of understanding the potential danger of widespread volcanic systems, as the eruption specifically came from the Holuhraun lava field/fissure vent northeast of the actual caldera.</p>
